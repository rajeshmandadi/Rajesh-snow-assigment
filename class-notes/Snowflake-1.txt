1,what is mean by snowflake?
  -->snowflake is cloud based data warehouse introdued in 2012
  -->it is mainly used for data storage,data processing,analytical solution
  -->snowflake does not have their own infracture
  -->it built on top of the aws,azure,gcp
  -->it supported to strecture data,semi strecture,unstrecture data
  -->it is a saas modal (software as-a service)
2,what is mean by ETL AND ELT TOOLS?
  -->ETL stands for Extract transform load
  -->ELT stands for Extract load transform
  -->Informatica,talend,matillion
  
3,what is mean by sql -->sql means strecture query language, it is not a database, for communicate aney 
						database we can use sql language
4,sub-language of sql-->
	--> DDL -->Data definaion language
		a,CREATE -->it is used to create database and table
		b,DROP -->it is used to drop the database and table
		c,ALTER: It is used to alter the structure of database (Table  3 1 column extra) 
	    d,TRUNCATE: It is used to remove all the records from a table 
	    e,COMMENT: It is used to add comments to the data dictonary 
	    f,RENAME: It is used to rename an objects existing in the database 
	--> DML --> Data Manipulation Language 
	    a,INSERT: It is used to insert the data into tables 
		b,UPDATE: It is used to update the existing data 
		c,DELETE: It is used to delete all records and particular records in a table 
    --> DQL --> Data Query Language
        a,SELECT:  It is used to retrive or display the records from database 
	
    --> DCL --> Data Control Language 
        a,GRANT: It is used to give user access /privileges to the database 
	    b,REVOKE: It is used to withdraws the User's access 
	
    --> TCL --> Transaction Cotrol Language 
        a,COMMIT: It is used to save transactions permanently 
	    b,ROLLBACK: It is used to revert the previuos tranactions before commit operations

 		
5,what is mean by database -->it is collection of data                                        					{strecture(table,format),semi-strecture(json,xmlf),un-strecture}
6,what is mean by warehouse --> we are using to store the data but the purpose is different 
                            --> historical data and analytical solution (large voulume of data)     							
7,data types --> INT/NUMBER,CHAR/VARCHAR/STRING, DATE/DECIMAL
8,What is mean by count(*)-->it display the all rows in table
9,what is mean by count(colum-name) -->it is used to excepted null values in a table

10,types of database-->MYSQL,ORACLE,DYNAMO-DB,MANGO-DB,POSTGRACE_SQL,HANA

11,What is mean by limit and offset?
    -->select * from employee
	   limit 1,  offset 5
	   -->limit 1 means display one (row) or (colum)
	   -->offset means display the after 5 rows (ex, 6)

12,Window functions:row_numbers-->it is unique values
	rank -->two rows have same vales, rank also same,but next rank also skip accordingly
	dense_rank -->two rows are same values,rank also same, but next rank is not skipped
	lag -->it is used to display crrent row to previous row
	lead -->it is used to display the current row to next rows
					
13,	Whatat is mean by sub_langguage ->it is used to query inside query is also sub-language
14,CASE	-->if,else
15,CTE  -->comman table expression

16,set operators  -->the sql set operations are used to combine the two or more sql select statement there 
					are four types
		-->UNION;it is used to display both table information but remove duplicate values
				  ex;-->table-1 rajesh,satish,mastan
				     -->Table-2 rajesh,vamsi,sudhakar
					 output;rajesh,satish,mastan,vamsi,sudhakar
		-->UNION ALL;it is used to display both table information do not remove dupliccate values
				  ex;-->table-1 rajesh,satish,mastan
				     -->Table-2 rajesh,vamsi,sudhakar
					output;rajesh,rajesh,mastan,vamsi,sudhakar
					
		-->minuse;
		-->intersect;it is used to display the both table common values
				  ex;-->table-1 rajesh,satish,mastan
				     -->Table-2 rajesh,vamsi,sudhakar
					output;rajesh,
		-->AND: It used to both condition is true 
		-->OR: 
		-->NOT: not operator is used to particular row excepted,  
		-->HAVING: HAVING is used to filter groups records.
		-->GROUP_BY: 
		-->ORDER BY: it print the output order wise (ASSENDING OR DESCNDING)
		-->DISTINCT:It print the unique values only fro one table 
		-->WHERE: it filter the records particular rows used to where condition
17,AGGRIGATE FUNCTIONS :
		-->AVG:
		-->SUM:
		-->MIN:
		-->MAX:
		-->CONCAT:
		-->UPPER:
		-->LOWER:
		
18,SQL JIONS : It is used to display the data from two are more tables
		-->INNER JOIN; It print the matching values from both table 
		-->LEFT JOIN; Print the all values from left side table, then mathched values from right side table
		-->RIGHT JOIN; Print the all values from right side table, then matched values from left side table
		-->FULL JOIN;  Print all rows from both table,if the matched values those rows will be merged,
						if there is no match null values include 
		-->SELF JOIN;  Itâ€™s used to compare rows within the same table,
		-->CROSS JOIN; it print the all values (N number of rows and N number of colums)cros multification 3*3 =9
		
19,what is the difference between traditional warehouse and and snowflake
                  traditional WH                                snowflake
1,scalability ->scaling can be difficult and          ->it can easily enabiling scaling up and 
				often expensive                          down
2,cost        ->traditional wh separate cost          ->in snowflake there is now infracture cost
                 we need to pay for that         
3,semi-strecture->we need to use the ETL tools        ->in snowflake we dont need to use aney tools
													      can process the data
4,data insert and
  retrive        ->we need to use ETL tools           ->we dont need to use aney tools we can use 
														  "copy" command
5,data backup ->we need to aditional storage       	  -> easily cloning,and no cost with cloning

6,data recovery->data is delete,retrive               ->data is delete, it is easily retrive 
                   is very difficult                    the data,time travel feature is available
7,data sharing->it is very difficult to sharing-data  -> it can easily to share the data

20,snowflake architecture  :there are 3 types of  architecture    

    a,database storage:-->data will be stored in columnar format
					   -->data will be stored in micro partitions
					   -->the data objects stored by snowflake are not directly visible are directly access by the customar 
					   -->we can also define cluster key on large data for better performance 

    b,query processing:-->This is the actual processing unit of snowflake
					   -->snowflake process queries using virtual warehouse
                       -->compute cost will be calculated on the basis of query execution time
					      on virtual warehouse 
					   -->vm also scale up and scale down automatically
					   -->auto suspend and auto resume is available
	c,cloud service:   -->collection of service that cordinate activities across snowflake
					   -->This the brain of the snowflake
					   -->Authentication and access control layer
					   -->infracture management 
					   -->metadata management
					   -->security
21,NEW REPO	-->GIT COMMAND
    -->git init
